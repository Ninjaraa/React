        <p>Really, you're gonna pull that move? I guided your entire civilisation. Your people have a holiday named ricksgiving.
          They teach kids about me in school. I mean, why would a poptart want to live inside a toaster, Rick? I mean, that would be like the scariest place for them to live.
          You know what I mean? Lemme hear everybody say hey-yo! All the ladies say yeaaah! Everybody over thirty do this with your hand! Everybody with a red shirt jump up and down!
          Yo, everyone whose first name begins with an L who isn't hispanic, walk in a circle the same number of times as the square root of your age times teeenn! No! Look away! I'm making an egg, Mom! Ughâ€¦! I'm making an egg!</p>
